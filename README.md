Perfect. I'm going to write you a full `README.md` you can drop into the project root.

I'll explain:

* what the app is
* why it's special (daily habits, 40-day streaks, reminders)
* tech stack (Laravel 12, Breeze auth, Blade UI)
* features (dashboard, progress tracking, streaks, categories, reminders)
* folder structure (like your `views/` screenshot)
* setup steps
* and a brag section: “built in ~5 hours by Hassam”.

You can literally copy-paste this into `README.md` and push to GitHub or send to client.

# Hassam Todo – Habit & Task Tracking Dashboard

Hassam Todo is a personal productivity and discipline tracker built with Laravel.  
It’s more than a normal TODO app. It's designed for real life routines like:
- praying on time every day,
- reading Quran daily,
- following a 40-day diet challenge,
- finishing one-time tasks before deadline,
- building streak discipline.

This app helps you **plan, do, and track** all of that in one place with a beautiful dashboard.

> ✅ Built from scratch in ~5 hours by Hassam using Laravel + Blade.

## 🔥 Core Idea

Most todo apps only do "task name + done / not done".

This app is different. It understands that not all tasks are equal.

We support 3 types of tasks:

1. **Daily Tasks (`type = daily`)**
   - These repeat every day (ex: Fajr prayer, Gym, Read 2 pages of Quran).
   - You can mark them "completed today" and the app tracks streaks.

2. **Period / Challenge Tasks (`type = specific_days`)**
   - Example: "Do keto diet for 40 days", "No sugar for 21 days", "Learn Laravel daily for 30 days".
   - You set `total_days` (like 40) and start date.
   - System calculates how many days you actually did it.
   - Shows progress percentage (% done so far).
   - Gives motivational messages like "🔥 Halfway there" or "🎉 Amazing progress" in the progress screen.

3. **One-Time Tasks (`type = one_time`)**
   - Example: "Submit assignment", "Call bank", "Buy domain".
   - Has optional `due_date` and optional `reminder_time`.

This is not just task storage.  
This is accountability and consistency.

## ✨ Main Features

### 1. Auth & Security
- Full authentication (login/register/forgot password) using **Laravel Breeze**.
- Only logged-in users can see / manage tasks.
- Each task belongs to a specific `user_id`.
- Authorization is enforced in controllers (`$this->authorize(...)`), so users can't touch each other’s tasks.

### 2. Beautiful Dashboard
Route: `/dashboard`

The dashboard view (`resources/views/tasks/index.blade.php`) gives you:
- **Welcome message** → "Welcome back, {username} 👋"
- **Stats cards** with:
  - Active Tasks
  - Completed Today
  - Total Completed (all time)
- **Sections split by type:**
  - Daily Tasks
  - Period / Challenge Tasks (like 40-day streak tasks)
  - One-Time Tasks

Each section is:
- modern UI (rounded cards, gradients like LinkedIn / Fiverr style),
- responsive mobile layout,
- action buttons (Complete / Undo / Edit),
- status indicators (priority colors, badges, reminder time, progress bar).

Example of what you see for a daily task:
```text
[✔] Fajr Prayer  | Daily | Worship | ⏰ 05:30 AM
[Complete] [Edit]
````

Example of what you see for a 40-day challenge task:

```text
Diet Plan (40 Days Challenge)
🔥 13/40 days done
Progress bar (32%)
[Mark Complete] [View Progress] [Edit]
```

### 3. Smart Stats

We calculate and show stats per user:

* `total_tasks` (active / pending tasks)
* `completed_today` (how many tasks you completed today)
* `total_completed` (total completions ever)

These numbers are prepared in `DashboardController@getDashboardStats()` and passed to the view.

So the dashboard is not static UI — it’s data-driven.

### 4. Daily Completion / Streak System

When you click **"Mark as complete"**:

* We create a record in `task_completions` table with `task_id` and `completion_date`.
* We never duplicate: we use `firstOrCreate` for today's date.
* You can also undo the completion for today.

This allows:

* tracking streaks,
* checking performance this week / month,
* checking if today is done or not,
* generating progression % for 40-day challenges.

### 5. Challenge Progress Screen

Route example: `/tasks/{task}/progress`

View: `resources/views/tasks/progress.blade.php`

Shows:

* Days completed
* Days remaining
* Total days
* Nice animated ring showing `%` complete
* Motivational block that changes based on your progress level:

  * “🌟 Begin Your Journey”
  * “🚀 Good Start”
  * “💪 Halfway There”
  * “🎉 Amazing Progress”

Also shows:

* Calendar-style this-week completion grid
* Completion history list (paged)

  * You see each day you completed it, formatted with date and weekday.

So this is basically analytics for your habit.

### 6. Task CRUD (Create / Edit / Delete)

We have stunning forms for:

* `Create Task` → `resources/views/tasks/create.blade.php`
* `Edit Task` → `resources/views/tasks/edit.blade.php`

These forms are not ugly default forms. They include:

* modern cards, gradients, soft shadows
* live conditional fields:

  * If you choose “Daily Task”, it shows info about habits
  * If you choose “Period Challenge”, it shows fields for `total_days` + `start_date`
  * If you choose “One-Time Task”, it shows `due_date`
  * JavaScript toggles these sections

Fields in a task:

* `title`
* `description`
* `type` (`daily`, `specific_days`, `one_time`)
* `total_days` / `start_date` (used for challenges like 40 days)
* `due_date` (for one-time tasks)
* `category` (Worship, Health, Work, Personal, Education, Family, etc.)
* `reminder_time`
* `priority` (`low`, `medium`, `high`)

Also:

* You can delete a task from the Edit page with confirmation.
* We validate input in controller using `$request->validate()`.

### 7. Priority / Badges / Styling

Tasks are visually flagged:

* left border color changes by priority

  * red = high
  * yellow = medium
  * green = low
* badges:

  * `Daily`
  * `40 Days Challenge`
  * Category badge like `🕌 Worship`, `💪 Health`, etc.
* progress bar for streak tasks (width set by %)

UI inspiration:

* clean spacing like LinkedIn dashboard cards
* gradients like Fiverr marketing cards
* friendly emojis and microcopy like modern SaaS onboarding

### 8. Authorization & Safety

In `TaskController`, we use:

```php
$this->authorize('update', $task);
$this->authorize('delete', $task);
$this->authorize('view', $task);
```

That means we use Laravel Policies to ensure only the owner can:

* edit,
* delete,
* mark complete,
* view progress.

So even if someone guesses `/tasks/5/edit`, they can't edit your task unless they own it.

### 9. Database Design

We use 2 core tables:

#### `tasks` table

Columns:

* `id`
* `user_id` (owner of the task)
* `title`
* `description`
* `type` (`daily`, `specific_days`, `one_time`)
* `total_days` (for challenges, e.g. 40 days)
* `start_date`
* `due_date`
* `reminder_time`
* `priority` (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
* `status` (`pending`, `completed`, `archived`)
* `category` (Worship, Health, Work, etc.)
* timestamps

#### `task_completions` table

Columns:

* `id`
* `task_id`
* `completion_date` (date only)
* `notes` (optional, like “felt tired today but still did it”)
* timestamps

We also enforce:

```php
$table->unique(['task_id', 'completion_date']);
```

That means you can only “complete” the task once per day. No fake spam.

## 🧠 How the App Works Behind the Scenes

### Controllers

* **DashboardController**

  * Builds the dashboard.
  * Groups tasks into: `$dailyTasks`, `$specificDaysTasks`, `$oneTimeTasks`.
  * Computes `$stats` (for the top cards).
  * Also knows how to calculate progress %, streaks, etc.

* **TaskController**

  * Handles CRUD.
  * Handles marking a task complete/uncomplete.
  * Handles progress page.
  * Handles archive / restore.

### Blade Views (Frontend UI)

From your screenshot, `resources/views` is organized like this:

```txt
views/
 ├─ auth/                       # login, register, reset password, etc. (from Breeze)
 ├─ components/                 # reusable component blades (buttons, modal, inputs)
 ├─ layouts/
 │    ├─ app.blade.php          # main layout when authenticated
 │    ├─ guest.blade.php        # layout for login/register pages
 │    └─ navigation.blade.php   # top nav / header
 ├─ profile/                    # profile edit pages (name, email, password, delete account)
 └─ tasks/
      ├─ index.blade.php        # dashboard (main view)
      ├─ create.blade.php       # create new task form
      ├─ edit.blade.php         # edit task form
      └─ progress.blade.php     # analytics & habit progress screen
```

### Layouts

* `layouts/app.blade.php`:

  * main shell after login
  * nav bar, container, fonts, etc.
* `layouts/guest.blade.php`:

  * minimal layout for login/register
* `layouts/navigation.blade.php`:

  * top navigation bar, user dropdown, logout link, etc.

This is standard Breeze structure, customized.

### Components

In `resources/views/components/` we have:

* `primary-button.blade.php`, `secondary-button.blade.php`, etc.
* `modal.blade.php`
* `create-task-modal.blade.php`
* `text-input.blade.php`
* etc.

These keep the UI consistent and reusable without repeating code.

## 🛠 Local Setup

1. Clone/download the project.

2. Install PHP dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then update:

   ```env
   DB_DATABASE=todo
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```

4. Generate app key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

   This creates:

   * `users`
   * `tasks`
   * `task_completions`
   * plus session / password reset tables (because Breeze & session driver)

6. Start local dev server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

7. Visit:

   * `http://127.0.0.1:8000/register` → make an account
   * `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard` → see your dashboard

## 💡 Key Business Value

Why this app is useful (for client / portfolio / employer):

* Tracks **daily spiritual habits** (prayers, Quran reading).
* Tracks **health routines** (diet, workout).
* Tracks **discipline challenges** (40-day consistency / 21-day detox / etc.).
* Tracks **normal work tasks** with deadlines.
* Shows **progress and streak mindset** (which motivates users).
* Clean, pro UI like modern SaaS.

This can easily be sold as:

* a productivity SaaS,
* an accountability journal,
* a “40 day challenge” platform,
* or even an Islamic habit tracker / deen consistency tracker.
